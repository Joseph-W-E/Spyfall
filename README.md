# Spyfall

I made my own version of Spyfall for Android.

The idea behind this version is that no server is needed. However, there are downsides to doing this.
* Every user needs to enter a new code each game.
* Every user needs to start (at roughly) the same time to sync up the clocks.

There are benefits, though.
* Users don't need internet access.
* Users don't need to rely on a web service being stable.

Don't cheat. It's easy to do, but it can make you look awful in front of your friends. This game is meant to be fun, and cheating will ruin that fun. You've been warned.

### This is a fan-made game!

I don't own any rights to this game, nor is it my idea. All intellectual property of this game belongs to (from my understanding) Alexandr Ushan (the designer), 
and the company behind the original board game, [http://international.hobbyworld.ru/|Hobby World].
This app is based off of another fan-made game, which you can visit at [spyfall.crabhat.com|spyfall.crabhat.com].
There is more information on that page. I highly suggest you checkout this game (or at least watch some people on YouTube play it).

To load this onto your device, simply clone the project, load it into Android Studio, and launch it on your device, or download it on the Play Store for free (no cost, no IAP, no ads).
